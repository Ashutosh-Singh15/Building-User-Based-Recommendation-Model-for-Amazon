# Building User-Based Recommendation Model for Amazon(Collaborative filtering)

## Project Description
* Some of the movies hadnâ€™t been watched and therefore, were not rated by the users. Built a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.

## Process
1)Exploratory Data Analysis

   * Displayed movies which have maximum views/ratings
   * Calculated the average rating for each movie. Defined the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings.
   * Defined the top 5 movies with the least audience.

2)Recommendation Model

   * Divided the data into training and test data
   * Built a recommendation model using SVD(Singular value decomposition) algorithm
   * Made predictions on the test data
